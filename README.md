person who wants to rent a car, they just find the car they want and make a contract online with the owner of this car.

# ðŸŽ‰ Getting started

## Setup Environment

- Create an account to use the S3 service in AWS.


Requirements
------------

* PHP 8.1 or higher;
* PDO-MySQL PHP extension enabled;
* and the [usual Symfony application requirements][2].

Installation
------------

[Download Symfony][4] to install the `symfony` binary on your computer and run
this command:

```bash
$ symfony new --demo my_project
```

Alternatively, you can use Composer:

```bash
$ composer create-project symfony/symfony-demo my_project
```

If you want to test the demo without installing anything locally, you can also
deploy it on Platform.sh, the official Symfony PaaS:

</p>

Usage
-----

Clone project to local:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/richardktran/CarForRentSymfony.git
```

Make a copy of the file `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
Edit all the parameters in `.env` corresponding to your environment
Install all necessary packages, and dependencies by using composer:

```bash
$ composer install
```

```bash
$ cd CarForRentSymfony/
$ symfony serve
```

Then access the application in your browser at the given URL (<https://localhost:8000> by default).

If you don't have the Symfony binary installed, run `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`
to use the built-in PHP web server or [configure a web server][3] like Nginx or
Apache to run the application.


Run the project and enjoy!
